            the 'food police' and environmental Chicken Littles to fuel wacky

            to gain personal fame and fortune.&quot; Run by lobbyist Steven Milloy, 
            it's actually a good example of junk science itself, heaping adolescent 
            insults on any and all scientists (ranging from Samuel Epstein to 
            the New England Journal of Medicine) who fail to defend the corporate, 
            anti-environmentalist worldview. When I call it &quot;adolescent,&quot; 
            I'm not exaggerating. Its attack on Dianne Dumanowski, for example, 
            resorts to schoolyard name-calling, referring to her as &quot;Dianne

          <li><b><font face="Arial">Narrow It Down. </font></b>This approach takes 
            about 30 minutes. The strategy is: (1) head to a minimum of three 
            or four different types of search engines. (2) Search through each, 
            quickly bookmarking any hits that looks promising. Don't visit the 
            page, just bookmark it. (3) After you've compiled a decent-sized list 
            of promising links, go through them, one by one. 
          <li><b><font face="Arial">Popularity Contest. </font></b>This approach
