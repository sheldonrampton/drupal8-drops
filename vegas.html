One of my earliest memories is watching him get ready for work.Wewould have dinner, and then he would hurry to change into his black tuxedoand bowtie. We would follow him to the door as he disappeared into the nightto perform his &quot;magic.&quot;</P><P>When I got a little older and my vocabulary expanded, I realized of coursethat there was a difference between &quot;magicians&quot; and &quot;musicians.&quot;My father had worked for a few years with a municipal orchestra in California,but the move to Las Vegas came when I was just three years old, and Vegasis where my real memories begin.</P><P>Vegas was a sort of mecca for performing artists--one of the few placeswhere a musician or dancer could find steady work and the middle-class stabilitythat comes with it. My father loved music, but he also cared about stability.In college he had studied accounting so he would have something to &quot;fallback on.&quot; Until Vegas came along, he never really believed that hecould make a permanent living as a performer, so the opportunities he foundthere must have seemed a little magical to him as well. Once we arrived,he never really looked further. Shortly before his death, the Las VegasMusicians Union awarded him a plaque as the city's &quot;longest-workingmusician.&quot; It is a record that will probably never be repeated, becauesthe heyday of house bands and lavish stage shows has already ended. Thegangsters who used to run the town may have been murderers and thieves,but they also liked a good party, and they knew the importance of loyalty.They kept people on the payroll even during the slow months when tourismwas slow. The corporate bean-counters who replaced them have taken out thebig shows and big bands, replacing them with keyboard synthesizers, tape-recordedmusic and small lounge acts. In today's world, my father might have turnedinto an accountant after all.</P><P>Our three-bedroom, one-story house at 229 Mallard Street was on the veryedge of town. From our back yard you looked directly out into untoucheddesert. The Strip, with its monuments to glitter and excess, was a 15-minutedrive away, but after we had seen it a few times, it lost its seeminglymagical glow and became a mere backdrop to our lives, which were in mostrespects quite conventional for a young family living in the United Statesin the innocent early 1960s.</P><P>There was still something magical about my father's profession, of course.His collection of instruments grew steadily over the years, and eventuallyhe converted our garage into a music room, soundproofed to minimize neighbors'complaints. His work night typically consisted of an early show which beganaround 7 in the evening, followed by a late show at around 10:00. He wouldusually come home between shows to watch television and relax. After thelate show ended, he would return sometime past midnight, often in the companyof other musicians who came to hang out and hold impromptu jazz sessions.</P><P><TABLE BORDER="0" CELLSPACING="0" CELLPADDING="0"><TR><TD ROWSPAN="2" VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="226"><IMG SRC="dad-elvis.jpg" WIDTH="226" HEIGHT="300" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></TD><TD WIDTH="12" ROWSPAN="2"></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="100%"></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="BOTTOM" WIDTH="100%"><EM><FONT SIZE=-1>This picture of my father (at left) was taken in the 1970swhile he was touring as part of Elvis Presley's band. He remembered Elvisas a shy, easygoing man who kept to himself. Most of my father's careerwas spent as a musician playing for Las Vegas hotel show bands, but he toureda few times with traveling bands.</FONT></EM></TD></TR></TABLE></P><P><CENTER><A HREF="mother.html"><IMG SRC="next.gif" WIDTH="108" HEIGHT="43" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" BORDER="0"></A></CENTER></P><P><CENTER><HR></CENTER></P><P><CENTER><A HREF="index.html">Sheldon Rampton's Homepage</A> | <A HREF="bbw/index.html">Visit My Online Bookstore</A></CENTER></BODY></HTML>
