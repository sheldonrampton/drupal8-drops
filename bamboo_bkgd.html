This book examines the manufacturing of &quot;independent       experts.&quot; Public relations firms and corporations have seized upon       a slick new way of getting you to buy what they have to sell: Let you hear       it from a neutral &quot;third party,&quot; like a professor or a pediatrician       or a soccer mom or a watchdog group. The problem is, these third parties       are usually anything but neutral. They have been handpicked, cultivated,       and meticulously packaged to make you believe what they have to say--preferably       in an &quot;objective&quot; format like a news show or a letter to the editor.       And in some cases, they have been paid handsomely for their opinions. Tufts       University professor Sheldon Krimsky says Trust Us, We're Experts &quot;explodes       the cult of expertise and shows how easily the media and their readers can       be misled by public relations claims masquerading as science. This book       makes the best case I know for complete disclosure of the financial conflicts       of interest of scientists and the corporate influence on university research.&quot;       Bill Moyers says, &quot;If you want to know how the world wags, and who's       wagging it, here's your answer.&quot;</p>  </blockquote>  <p><b><font size="+1">Author, <i>Mad Cow USA</i></font></b>, <i>5/1/96 to 8/1/97</i></p>  <blockquote>     <p>Co-author, with John Stauber, of <a href="http://www.prwatch.org/books/index3.html"  target="_blank">Mad Cow USA: Could the Nightmare Happen Here?</a> This book       examines the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), a bizarre       and deadly class of diseases which hit the headlines in the 1996 when England       announced that young people were dying from &quot;new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob       Disease,&quot; a TSE which they contracted by eating beef contaminated with       mad cow disease. Published in 1997, <i>Mad Cow USA</i> shows how the disease       emerged as a result of factory farming practices which are still widespread       in the United States and which continue to pose a risk to animal and human       health. Jeremy Rifkin calls <i>Mad Cow USA</i> a &quot;chilling revealing       book about what really goes on behind the scenes in the meat industry.&quot;       <i>Library Journal</i> calls it &quot;gripping . . . important . . . highly       recommended.&quot; <i>New Scientist</i> calls it &quot;accessible and informative,&quot;       an &quot;exhaustive exploration of the people, the ideas and the growing       understanding of TSEs.&quot;</p>  </blockquote>  <p><b><font size="+1">Editor, <i>PR Watch</i></font></b>, <i>4/1/94 to Present</i></p>  <blockquote>     <p>Editor of a quarterly newsletter, published by the <a href="http://www.prwatch.org/"  target="_blank">Center for Media &amp; Democracy</a> (CMD), which offers investigative       journalism and critical analysis of the public relations industry.

It serves citizens, journalists and researchers seeking to recognize       and combat manipulative and misleading PR practices involving issues such       as health, consumer safety and the environment.

Published in 1995 by Common Courage Press, <i>Toxic       Sludge</i> reveals how public relations firms such as Hill &amp; Knowlton       and Burson-Marsteller control political debates and public opinion, spinning       and twisting news and reality, and protecting the powerful from scrutiny.       The book has received glowing reviews from <i>Publishers Weekly</i> and       <i>Choice</i>. The <i>Village Voice</i> called it &quot;a font of knowledge       on the anti-knowledge biz.&quot; According to <i>Public Relations Quarterly</i>,       &quot;<i>Toxic Sludge</i> should appear on the short list of anyone serious       about the study of public relations in the United States.&quot;</p>  </blockquote>  <p><b><font size="+1">Outreach Coordinator, NICA Fund</font></b>, <i>2/1/94     to 4/1/99</i></p>  <blockquote>     <p>As an employee of the <a href="http://www.execpc.com/~wccn"  target="_blank">Wisconsin Coordinating Council on Nicaragua</a> (WCCN), a Madison-based       nonprofit organization, I worked to develop an alternative credit program       that has channeled more than $7 million in loans to promote job creation       and economic development in low-income Nicaraguan communities.
