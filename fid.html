In addition, the book includes a directory ofover 180 organizations participating in &quot;citizen diplomacy&quot;activities in Central America, along with how-to information aboutfundraising, volunteer recruitment, media outreach and publicrelations for small organizations.</P><P><TABLE BORDER="0" CELLSPACING="0" CELLPADDING="0">  <TR>    <TD ALIGN="RIGHT"><STRONG>Dave Merritt (pictured here on the      left) was a staff member for the <A HREF="http://www.execpc.com/~wccn"      TARGET="_blank">Wisconsin Coordinating Council on Nicaragua (WCCN)</A>      during my first trip there, which WCCN sponsored in 1985.
