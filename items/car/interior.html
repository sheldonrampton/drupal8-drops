<h2>1992 Eagle Summit: Interior</h2>
<p><img src="PDRM0114.jpg" width="672" height="450"></p>
<p>In this picture of the front interior, I've drawn a red arrow pointing to the 
  coin compartment. The door to the compartment fell off a year or two ago, but 
  I still keep coins in it. Everything on the dashboard works as expected, with 
  the following exceptions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The AM/FM radio works, but I stopped using the cassette tape player after 
    it destroyed several of my tapes.</li>
  <li>This car does not have a cigarette lighter.</li>
</ul>
