<h2>1992 Eagle Summit: Engine</h2>
<p>Here are some shots inside the hood of the car. I'm not aware of any engine 
  problems or oil leaks. The battery was purchased in 1999 and had a 60-month 
  warranty. I put in a new clutch late last year, and four new tires in March 
  or April of this year. The car will need a new brake job when it gets up around 
  115,000 miles. I think I also put in a new alternator a year or so ago. Other 
  than that, the car hasn't needed any repairs and has run well since I bought 
  it used from a local car dealer in 1996.</p>
