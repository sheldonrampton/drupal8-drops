We are very grateful for this, since it was always a favorite of ours to recommend and one of the most asked-for out-of-print titles. The novel explores the idea that life can look very different depending on the choices made at key turns, and that idea is developed by presenting three different versions of the main character's life. It succeeds wonderfully well, and Anshaw's wit and unique voice and style make reading this book a delightful as well as interesting experience. Because this book is provocative in many regards, it is a great choice for book groups.<BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR>  <HR ALIGN=LEFT>  <DT><A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN%3D0965665909/sheldonramptonA/" TARGET="_blank"><IMG SRC="order.gif" WIDTH="83" HEIGHT="33" ALIGN="RIGHT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" BORDER="0"></A><STRONG><FONT SIZE=+1>Does Your Mama Know?

Given that the connection between lesbianism and athleticism is one of our oldest cultural stereotypes, the mere fact that it is only now being addressed suggests how loaded a subject it is. Griffin does a superb job of showing how homophobia interacts with sexism to limit women's full access to sports and therefore to all the benefits -- physical, psychological, and social -- that derive from participating in sports. This is a very important book for all those who live, work, and play in the world of sports, but also for those interested in girls' development and in the overarching issues of women's equality and social justice.<BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR>  <HR ALIGN=LEFT>  <DT><A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN%3D0889740682/sheldonramptonA/" TARGET="_blank"><IMG SRC="order.gif" WIDTH="83" HEIGHT="33" ALIGN="RIGHT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" BORDER="0"></A><STRONG><FONT SIZE=+1>Sunnybrook</FONT></STRONG><BR><STRONG>A True Story With Lies</STRONG><BR><EM>By Persimmon Blackbridge</EM><DD>This is the hilarious and tragic tale of Diane, a woman who fakes her way into a job at "Sunnybrook Institution for the Mentally Handicapped," a choice that ultimately changes her life.
