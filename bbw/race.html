Ironically, in recent years it has been occasionally labeled itself as a racist book. In 1996 in Tempe, Arizona, it was challenged in the Union High School District after a parent requested that all books containing expressions that could be offensive to minority students be removed from school reading lists. Removed from the required reading lists in East San Jose, Calif. high schools (1995) in response to objections raised by African-American parents. They said the book's use of racial epithets, including the frequent use of word "nigger," erodes their children's self esteem and affects their performance in school. Considered "dangerous" because of objectionable language and "racist" terms and content. Challenged by Winnetka, Illinois, 1976; Warrington, Pennsylvania, 1981; Davenport, Iowa, 1981; Fairfax County, Virginia, 1982; Houston, Texas, 1982; State College, Pennsylvania, area school district 1983; Springfield, Illinois, 1983 Waukegan, Illinois, 1984.<BR>  <EM>Other Topics Related to This Book: </EM><A HREF="fiction.html">Fiction &amp; Poetry</A>.<BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR>  <HR ALIGN=LEFT>  <DT><A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN%3D0060812508/sheldonramptonA/" TARGET="_blank"><IMG SRC="order.gif" WIDTH="83" HEIGHT="33" ALIGN="RIGHT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" BORDER="0"></A><STRONG><FONT SIZE=+1>Black Boy</FONT></STRONG><BR><EM>By Richard Wright</EM><DD>Richard Wright's pathbreaking book about the black experience in the U.S. was removed, along with nine other titles, by Island Trees, New York, schools in 1976.

Although an alternative reading assignment was available, the book was challenged due to "inappropriate language, graphic sexual scenes, and book's negative of black men." Considered inappropriate because of its "troubling ideas about race relations, man's relationship to God, African history and human sexuality."

In his newest book, Ignatieff continues his exploration of the causes of ethnic conflict in these regions, examining how they began, how they escalated into genocidal war, and how the West has viewed and dealt with them. He looks at the paradox of modern media coverage of war, which at the height of conflict can provoke a global empathy unique to this era, yet is too fickle and inconsistent to keep our attention on any one conflict for long. He travels with Boutros Boutros-Ghali around Africa, stopping in Rwanda, Zaire, and Angola, and learns from him the political frustrations that have all but immobilized the U.N. in its ability to deal with these wars the way many in the West think they should be addressed. He also offers a history of the Red Cross, which follows the organization from its birth in 1864 to modern day, using this topic as a point of departure, like all of the essays in this book, to analyze the ever-changing state of modern warfare, ethnic conflict, how we view them now, and how we need to begin looking at them in the future.<BR>  <EM>Other Topics Related to This Book: </EM><A HREF="war.html">War</A>.<BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR>  <HR ALIGN=LEFT>  <DT><A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN%3D1567510507/sheldonramptonA/" TARGET="_blank"><IMG SRC="order.gif" WIDTH="83" HEIGHT="33" ALIGN="RIGHT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" BORDER="0"></A><STRONG><FONT SIZE=+1>White Lies, White Power</FONT></STRONG><BR><STRONG>The Fight Against White Supremacy and Reactionary Violence</STRONG><DD>&quot;This powerful book explores the lasting power of racism in daily life. Novick places most of the blame on the political and economic system that the U.S. has firmly in place. While racist groups, such as the Ku Klux Klan, can attract attention (and new adherents) by making easy scapegoats of certain peoples, Novick argues it would be wrong to think of such groups as representing a 'fringe.' They exist precisely because they reflect feelings deeply held by the society and the state.&quot; You'll get your money's worth from buying this book if you just read the chapter on the Los Angeles Police Department.<BR>  <EM>Other Topics Related to This Book: </EM><A HREF="human1.html">Human Rights</A>.<BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR> </DL><P><CENTER><A HREF="index.html">TopicGuide</A> | <A HREF="mailto:sheldon@execpc.com">Send Me YOUR Book Recommendations</A></CENTER></BODY></HTML>
