In 1996 in Tempe, Arizona, it was challenged  in the Union High School District after a parent requested that  all books containing expressions that could be offensive to minority  students be removed from school reading lists. Removed from the  required reading lists in East San Jose, Calif. high schools  (1995) in response to objections raised by African-American parents.  They said the book's use of racial epithets, including the frequent  use of word &quot;nigger,&quot; erodes their children's self  esteem and affects their performance in school. Considered &quot;dangerous&quot;  because of objectionable language and &quot;racist&quot; terms  and content.
