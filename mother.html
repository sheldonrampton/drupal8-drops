By then, however, I was old enough andstrong to hit back, and I told her as much. &quot;All right,&quot; she said,&quot;I'll let your father take care of you when he gets home. If you thinka spanking from <EM>me</EM> is bad, wait until he gets <EM>his</EM> handson you.&quot;</P><P>By the time my father arrived, Mom had had a few hours to build up ahead of anger, and she made sure that he got an earful. &quot;Come here,&quot;he said, giving me a stern glare. He led me into the garage, shut the door,and undid his belt.</P><P>By this time I was shaking. He took the belt, doubled it over, and flexedit in his hands. Then he gave me a broad conspiratorial wink and whispered,&quot;When I snap the belt, scream real loud.&quot;</P><P>He knew just how to snap the belt by pulling at both ends so that thefolded-over parts of the belt slapped against each other, making a crackingnoise that sounded just like what you would hear if I was actually beingwhipped. Each time he did, I let out a loud yell. After a few minutes ofthis charade, we returned to the house, doing our best to keep from smirking.</P><P>Years later I told my mother what really happened that day, and she gotmad all over again. &quot;That's what I dealt with from him all the time,&quot;she said. &quot;He never backed me up -- not with discipline, not with money,not with anything. I was always the one who had to play the heavy, and hegot to look like the good guy, because he never worried about taking careof business.&quot;</P><P>Maybe that explains why my childhood memories of my father are so muchwarmer than my memories of my mother. I remember him showing us how to ridehorses, shopping for trinkets in Tijuana, or taking us to rides at Disneylandor Sea World. Often these theme parks hired small bands to provide freeentertainment at strategic locations. We would stop and listen, and aftersome badgering Dad would agree to ask if they would let him &quot;sit in&quot;for a few numbers. It seemed that there was no style he couldn't play--classical,jazz, rock, Latin American folk music.</P><P><CENTER><HR></CENTER></P><P><CENTER><A HREF="index.html">Sheldon Rampton's Homepage</A> | <A HREF="bbw/index.html">Visit My Online Bookstore</A></CENTER></BODY></HTML>
