This book examines  the manufacturing of &quot;independent experts.&quot; Public  relations firms and corporations have seized upon a slick new  way of getting you to buy what they have to sell: Let you hear  it from a neutral &quot;third party,&quot; like a professor or  a pediatrician or a soccer mom or a watchdog group. The problem  is, these third parties are usually anything but neutral. They  have been handpicked, cultivated, and meticulously packaged to  make you believe what they have to say--preferably in an &quot;objective&quot;  format like a news show or a letter to the editor. And in some  cases, they have been paid handsomely for their opinions. Tufts  University professor Sheldon Krimsky says Trust Us, We're Experts  &quot;explodes the cult of expertise and shows how easily the  media and their readers can be misled by public relations claims  masquerading as science. This book makes the best case I know  for complete disclosure of the financial conflicts of interest  of scientists and the corporate influence on university research.&quot;  Bill Moyers says, &quot;If you want to know how the world wags,  and who's wagging it, here's your answer.&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial">Author, <I>Mad Cow USA</I></FONT></B>,<I>5/1/96 to 8/1/97</I></P><BLOCKQUOTE>  <P>Co-author, with John Stauber, of <A HREF="http://www.prwatch.org/books/index3.html"  TARGET="_blank">Mad Cow USA: Could the Nightmare Happen Here?</A>  This book examines the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies  (TSEs), a bizarre and deadly class of diseases which hit the  headlines in the 1996 when England announced that young people  were dying from &quot;new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease,&quot;  a TSE which they contracted by eating beef contaminated with  mad cow disease.
