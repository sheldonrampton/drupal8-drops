Their conversion to Mormonism occurred in 1861 when missionaries visitedtheir home in ****, a Danish town near Copenhagen. In those days, Mormonconverts were strongly encouraged to &quot;gather to Zion&quot; so theycould build the Kingdom of God that Brigham Young was busily establishingin southwestern United States. Their departure in 1862 came as America wasembroiled in its Civil War, and the apocalyptic prophecies of Mormon scripturecould only have intensified their sense that they were embarking upon ajourney into the very heart of horror.
