He is a handsome man, with angular features and carefullygroomed hair. He wears a dark shirt, a dark tie, and a white shirt -- aformal costume, showing the taking of this photograph to have been morethan a casual event. You notice an unsmiling expression and the lack offlesh at his cheeks, but your attention comes back most often to his intenselyearnest eyes, which stare out from beneath heavy, solid brows, their gazetraversing more than a century. And that is all we have of him, the patriarch:one image, one split-second in time preserved within the pages of an obscurefamily album, occasionally resurfacing.</P><P>Next to him, on the same page, is a portrait of his wife: a small, square,severe face, its hair tied back in a tight and temperate bun. A knobby nose.Obstinate, glaring eyes. Dark, definite lines around the mouth, as thoughshe has spent most of her life clenching her jaws. She is the practicalone of the two. You can imagine her preparing meals, disciplining children,managing each chore and transaction with the grim penurious determinationof necessity. It is difficult, though, to imagine any romance in her. Herlife is all struggle and survival. Her dress would look appropriate at anyfuneral ceremony, made of dark gathered material with a lace frill at thechest and some sort of ornament around the neck. Whether it is a ribbonor a broach you cannot tell, the photograph being to grainy for much detail.</P><P>The Mormon system of genealogical record-keepking provides a standardizedsystem for assembling these small fragments from the past. Beneath the husbandand wife, place pictures of the children, proceeding vertically from theoldest at the top to the youngest at the bottom. Next to each photographappear the dates and locations for birth, marriage, death. By the sidesof the father an mother appear the names of their respective parents. Eachpage thus becomes a record of three generations, documenting one link ina chain which in theory reaches back to the first parents themselves, Adamand Eve.</P><P>The album also contains a large photograph, from which the father isnotably absent. It shows the entire family standing in front of what lookslike a corral, each member dressed in his or her Sunday best. It is tooblurred to show their faces clearly. Behind the posts and wooden poles ofthe corral are what appear to be three separate buildings. The one on theright stands considerably taller than the other two, and at the apex ofits slanting roof a narrow sign is mounted, stretching from one end to theother. It bears his name and a quaintly misspelled advertisement: &quot;F.P.PETERSEN -- DEALER OF MERCHANDIZE AND PRODUCTS.&quot;</P><P><TABLE BORDER="0" CELLSPACING="0" CELLPADDING="0"><TR><TD ROWSPAN="2" VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="226"><IMG SRC="../dad-elvis.jpg" WIDTH="226" HEIGHT="300" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></TD><TD WIDTH="12" ROWSPAN="2"></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="100%"></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="BOTTOM" WIDTH="100%"><EM><FONT SIZE=-1>This picture of my father (at left) was taken in the 1970swhile he was touring as part of Elvis Presley's band. He remembered Elvisas a shy, easygoing man who kept to himself.
