In addition, the book includes a directory of over 180  organizations participating in &quot;citizen diplomacy&quot;  activities in Central America, along with how-to information  about fundraising, volunteer recruitment, media outreach and  public relations for small organizations.  <LI><A HREF="http://www.prwatch.org/tsigfy.html">Toxic Sludge  Is Good For You! Lies, Damn Lies and the Public Relations Industry</A><EM>  </EM>is a critical and sometimes humorous expose of the PR industry.  Published in 1995, <EM>Toxic Sludge </EM>names names and reveals  how public relations wizards concoct and spin the news, organize  phony &quot;grassroots&quot; front groups, spy on citizens, and  conspire with lobbyists and politicians to thwart democracy.  The book has received glowing reviews from <EM>Publishers Weekly  </EM>and <EM>Choice</EM>. The <EM>Village Voice </EM>called it  &quot;a font of knowledge on the anti-knowledge biz.&quot; The  <EM>San Francisco Bay Guardian </EM>called it &quot;some of the  best investigative reporting around.&quot; According to <EM>Public  Relations Quarterly</EM>, &quot;<EM>Toxic Sludge </EM>should  appear on the short list of anyone serious about the study of  public relations in the United States.&quot; Good Morning America  called it &quot;a book that proves these flacks are hacks.&quot;  <LI><A HREF="http://www.prwatch.org/mcusa.html">Mad Cow USA:  Could the Nightmare Happen Here?</A><EM> </EM>England's epidemic  of mad cow disease has been called &quot;the world's worst food  scare,&quot; and with good reason. In 1996, British beef markets  collapsed when the public learned that young people were dying  from a related disease called &quot;new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob  Disease&quot; (nvCJD) which they contracted by eating infected  beef. <EM>Mad Cow USA </EM>shows how the disease emerged as a  result of factory farming practices which are still widespread  in the United States and which continue to pose a risk to animal  and human health, notwithstanding government and industry denials.  Jeremy Rifkin calls <EM>Mad Cow USA </EM>a &quot;chilling revealing  book about what really goes on behind the scenes in the meat  industry.&quot; <EM>Library Journal </EM>calls it &quot;gripping  ... important ... highly recommended.&quot;</UL><H3>Periodicals</H3><UL>  <LI>Newspaper reporter for the <EM>Valley Times </EM>(daily:  circulation 4,500) in Las Vegas, Nevada.
